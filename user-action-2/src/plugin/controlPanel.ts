  /**
   * The control panel is split into two tabs: "Query" and
   * "Chart Options". The controls that define the inputs to
   * the chart data request, such as columns and metrics, usually
   * reside within "Query", while controls that affect the visual
   * appearance or functionality of the chart are under the
   * "Chart Options" section.
   *
   * There are several predefined controls that can be used.
   * Some examples:
   * - groupby: columns to group by (translated to GROUP BY statement)
   * - series: same as groupby, but single selection.
   * - metrics: multiple metrics (translated to aggregate expression)
   * - metric: sane as metrics, but single selection
   * - adhoc_filters: filters (translated to WHERE or HAVING
   *   depending on filter type)
   * - row_limit: maximum number of rows (translated to LIMIT statement)
   *
   * If a control panel has both a `series` and `groupby` control, and
   * the user has chosen `col1` as the value for the `series` control,
   * and `col2` and `col3` as values for the `groupby` control,
   * the resulting query will contain three `groupby` columns. This is because
   * we considered `series` control a `groupby` query field and its value
   * will automatically append the `groupby` field when the query is generated.
   *
   * It is also possible to define custom controls by importing the
   * necessary dependencies and overriding the default parameters, which
   * can then be placed in the `controlSetRows` section
   * of the `Query` section instead of a predefined control.
   *
   * import { validateNonEmpty } from '@superset-ui/core';
   * import {
   *   sharedControls,
   *   ControlConfig,
   *   ControlPanelConfig,
   * } from '@superset-ui/chart-controls';
   *
   * const myControl: ControlConfig<'SelectControl'> = {
   *   name: 'secondary_entity',
   *   config: {
   *     ...sharedControls.entity,
   *     type: 'SelectControl',
   *     label: t('Secondary Entity'),
   *     mapStateToProps: state => ({
   *       sharedControls.columnChoices(state.datasource)
   *       .columns.filter(c => c.groupby)
   *     })
   *     validators: [validateNonEmpty],
   *   },
   * }
   *
   * In addition to the basic drop down control, there are several predefined
   * control types (can be set via the `type` property) that can be used. Some
   * commonly used examples:
   * - SelectControl: Dropdown to select single or multiple values,
       usually columns
   * - MetricsControl: Dropdown to select metrics, triggering a modal
       to define Metric details
   * - AdhocFilterControl: Control to choose filters
   * - CheckboxControl: A checkbox for choosing true/false values
   * - SliderControl: A slider with min/max values
   * - TextControl: Control for text data
   *
   * For more control input types, check out the `incubator-superset` repo
   * and open this file: superset-frontend/src/explore/components/controls/index.js
   *
   * To ensure all controls have been filled out correctly, the following
   * validators are provided
   * by the `@superset-ui/core/lib/validator`:
   * - validateNonEmpty: must have at least one value
   * - validateInteger: must be an integer value
   * - validateNumber: must be an integer or decimal value
